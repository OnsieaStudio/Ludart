- **Useful information** - If possible, you can specify sample code or a scenario where the problem is or would be apparent.

- **Predict and solve** - Even without having suffered a problem, you can very well, take a code as an example, while specifying that this one could be in the future a source of problem, on what scale, to what extent, in which scenario etc.

## Suggest improvements

- **Model** - To help you a [model](https://github.com/OnsieaStudio/Ludani/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) to suggest improvement is at your disposal

- **Useful information** - You can specify how this idea improves anything and in what aspect (performance, stability, code readability etc)

- **Cosmetic improvement ?** - All improvements suggestions are taken seriously, including readability, layout, formatting etc of the code.

  - **Yes all the same** - despite everything, some choices may have been made for a specific reason, so we will never choose the beauty of the code to the detriment of bugs, various problems etc.

  - **Traceability of choices** - thus, following a request of this type, if it was not accepted with valid justification, it will be published in the "choice / <path_to_class> /class.txt" folder (for example (choice / fr / onsiea / ludart / Main), so in the future it will not be necessary to propose this improvement (at least, with the same arguments) and it will not be necessary to find the justification - which takes much less time.

  - **And therefore in final ?** - therefore you can check in the folder "choice / <path_to_the_class> /class.txt" if your proposal has not already been made, you can also obtain the reason
